		    for Several years ago I could be found enlisted as Airman First Class Urciuoli in the army of COBOL programmers fighting to get the code changed before the strike of midnight Y2K.  With grit and determination (and a little luck), we were able to avoid the dreaded Mad Max scenario just in the nick of time! <br><br>
			Since then I've been out of the limelight acting as a barber (on my own kids' heads), a baker (muffins and donuts at a supermarket near you) and candlestick maker (actually as more of a connoisseur). <br><br> Not wanting to slow down just yet, I decided it was time to return to bootcamp.  Currently, I can be found wading deep in the weeds at Rutgers bootcamp for aspiring web coders in Somerset NJ.
